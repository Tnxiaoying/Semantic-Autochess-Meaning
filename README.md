# Semantic Autochess: Thermodynamics of Meaning

Code and data for my third paper on AI thermodynamics (working title):
**"The Information: Semantic Entropy and Thermodynamic Dissipation in Large Models"**.

This folder contains:

- `semantic_autochess_sim.py` – main semantic auto-chess simulator.
- `Semantic_Autochess_Simulation.py` – an earlier / alternative implementation.
- `sensitivity_analysis.py`, `sensitivity_analysis (副本).py` – sensitivity / robustness experiments.
- `Figure_1.png` ... `Figure_5.png` – figures used in the paper.
- `语义熵实验报告*.odt`, `元数据.odt` – experimental reports and metadata (Chinese).

- Paper 2 — Chinchilla thermodynamics:      `Chinchilla-Scaling-Thermodynamics`

All scripts are pure Python and are meant to be run with Python 3.10+.
